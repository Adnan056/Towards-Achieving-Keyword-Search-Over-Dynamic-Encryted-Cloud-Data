# Towards-Achieving-Keyword-Search-Over-Dynamic-Encryted-Cloud-Data
This is a project that focus on security and control over the flow of data from the owner of the data to the consumer of the data.
It is based on the topics of cloud settings and the cryptography.
It acts as a front as a website where you can upload and download the data but you do need to seek the approval of the owner of the data for downloading and reading the data for security purpose.
It reads the transactions between the owner and the user involving data transfer, ranks the data based on its view count, registers the time delay and CPU speed on uploading and downloading the data
